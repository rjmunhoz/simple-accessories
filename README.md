This is a very early stage version of the mod. More items are yet to be implemented. Please leave any ideas in the comments below, or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rjmunhoz/simple-accessories/issues)

## WIP

This is a work-in-progress, and is being developed as my learning project on Minecraft Modding.
You wil, probably, encouter weired stuff as I get into more complicated things, and you may also feel like some things are missing.
Anyway, let me know what you think about the mod, and any possible improvement suggestions.
